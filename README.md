# Startup Bounty

I need to read a value from disk, and I haven't been able to do that. 

The value has to be read from disk in the `main` function, before calling `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`.

If you can implement this functionality I will send you $100 USD

## Requirements

- If you write the data to a file, the path has to come from the official documents directory for the platform it's running on

- You can't use a backend solutions

## Submission

Submit a PR with your solution along with an explanation of what you did and how it works.

## This is my solution
